1) Goal
Given a user audio file, return a cohesive virtual band concept:
    • band_name
    • band_motto
    • band_identity (short positioning statement)
    • band_lore (150–250 words)
    • members[] (1–5 names + role + 1-line trait)
    • image_prompt (for image generator)
    • tags[] (genres/moods/visual cues)
2) Two presets (query param mode)
    • mode=explore (ideate broadly): temperature 0.9, top_p 0.95, n 4
    • mode=refine (polish one): temperature 0.4, top_p 0.9, n 1
3) Prompt shape (system/dev/user)
    • system: “You are a creative music world-builder. Tone: gothic-futurist, evocative, commercially usable. Avoid real artist name-drops.”
    • developer: “Stay concise. Respect JSON schema. Use original names. No copyrighted bands. Keep lore 150–250 words.”
    • user (variables): includes audio URL + optional descriptors.
{
  "audio_url": "https://example.com/user_uploads/track.mp3",
  "artist_intent": "dark pop + cyber goth, cinematic",
  "mood_words": ["neon", "haunted", "uplifting"],
  "use_audio_features": true
}
4) OpenAI / xAI request templates
OpenAI (chat completions)
{
  "model": "gpt-5-thinking",
  "temperature": 0.9,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "n": 4,
  "messages": [
    {"role":"system","content":"You are a creative music world-builder. Tone: gothic-futurist, evocative, commercially usable. Avoid real artist name-drops."},
    {"role":"developer","content":"Return strict JSON matching the schema. Original names only. Lore 150–250 words. Include an image_prompt for a cover/poster. No extra text."},
    {"role":"user","content":"Audio: https://example.com/user_uploads/track.mp3\nIntent: dark pop + cyber goth, cinematic\nMoods: neon, haunted, uplifting\nTask: Generate band_name, band_motto, band_identity, band_lore, 3–5 members (name, role, trait), tags[], image_prompt. The track may start a new band or join an existing one; lean into world-building."}
  ],
  "response_format": {"type":"json_object"}
}
xAI (Grok) — same idea; map params accordingly
{
  "model": "grok-2",
  "temperature": 0.9,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "messages": [
    {"role":"system","content":"You are a creative music world-builder..."},
    {"role":"user","content":"(same user block as above)"}
  ]
}
If you’re actually analyzing audio features, do that app-side (tempo/key/timbre via a lightweight DSP lib) and pass extracted features into the user message. Don’t rely on the LLM to “hear” the file.
5) Response schema (contract)
Have the model return exactly this shape:
{
  "band_name": "string",
  "band_motto": "string",
  "band_identity": "string",
  "band_lore": "string",
  "members": [
    {"name":"string","role":"string","trait":"string"}
  ],
  "tags": ["string","string"],
  "image_prompt": "string"
}
6) Simple auto-selector (only when mode=explore)
Ask for n=4, then pick the best one with a tiny rubric:
Scores (0–1 each):
    • Novelty (penalize near-duplicate names across candidates)
    • Clarity (short, readable sentences)
    • BrandFit (hits life/ghost/world-building vibes; no banned phrases)
    • ConstraintFit (schema valid; lore length ok)
Weighted sum:
Score = 0.35*BrandFit + 0.25*ConstraintFit + 0.25*Novelty + 0.15*Clarity
Return: winner + alternates (with scores) for A/B.
7) Image generation (second call)
Use image_prompt from the winner to call your image model (OpenAI Images, Flux, SDXL, etc.). Example style for the model prompt:
“Album cover, gothic-futurist neon, cinematic lighting, [band_name] emblem motif, [tags], high contrast, clean typography space, 1:1”
8) Banned/guardrails (env-driven)
    • No real artist/band name references.
    • No explicit claims like “guaranteed fame”.
    • Max lore length 250 words.
    • Names must be unique per user (app-side check).
9) One-liner dev tasks
    1. Add mode param → set gen params (temperature, n).
    2. Send chat with system/dev/user blocks; request json_object.
    3. If mode=explore, score 4 candidates → pick winner.
    4. Return { winner, alternates, image_prompt }.
    5. Fire image call with image_prompt.
If you want, I can also give you a 30-line JS helper that wraps this (OpenAI SDK), runs the scoring, and returns the winner + prompt for the image call.
